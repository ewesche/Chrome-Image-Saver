This chrome extension allows you to save images you see on the web and put them into a folder. It saves the link of the page the image was on so that you can go back to it later.

An example usage is if you are shopping online, you can save images of products you like.

Usage for running / developing: 

1. run 'npm install'
2. run 'npm run build'
3. Click load unpacked button at the top left in chrome://extensions and select the build folder.
4. The extension will open when you open a new tab.
5. You can run 'npm run start' which makes the extension update automatically when the code changes. 
   Instructions are on the page that opens.
